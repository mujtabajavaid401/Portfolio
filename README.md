#  [Project 1: Speech Emotion Recognition: Project Overview](https://github.com/mujtabajavaid401/speech_emotion_recognition)

In this project I am trying to develop a system that is able to detect human emotion based on a persons voice.

I am using a dataset that contains voices of a number people which are labelled by a number of annotators in-terms of the emotions the tone and pitch of these voices indicate i.e anger or happy etc 

The voices are are processed to extract features which a model can understand and use to it for classifications purposes.These features that are extracted include mfcc or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient that indicates the short-term power spectrum of a sound, chroma and mel or Mel Spectrogram Frequency.

# [Project 2: Breast cancer Detection: Project Overview](https://github.com/mujtabajavaid401/breast_cancer_detection)

The risk of developing breast cancer is continouslly emmerging.The early detection of it in the patient can surrelly increase the survival rate.

In this project I am to develop a machine learning model that can be used to which could classify tumours present in a patient that could eventually result in breast cancer.

Values present in the dataset includes tumor radius which is mainly the distances from center to points on the perimeter,texture as in standard deviation of gray-scale values, perimeter, area, smoothness indicating the local variation in radius lengths, compactness i.e perimeter² / area — 1.0, concavity as in severity of concave portions of the contour, concave points or number of concave portions of the contour, symmetry and fractal dimension.
