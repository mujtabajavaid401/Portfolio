#  [Project 1: Speech Emotion Recognition: Project Overview](https://github.com/mujtabajavaid401/speech_emotion_recognition)

In this project I am trying to develop a system that is able to detect human emotion based on a persons voice.

I am using a dataset that contains voices of a number people which are labelled by a number of annotators in-terms of the emotions the tone and pitch of these voices indicate i.e anger or happy etc 

The voices are are processed to extract features which a model can understand and use to it for classifications purposes.These features that are extracted include mfcc or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient that indicates the short-term power spectrum of a sound, chroma and mel or Mel Spectrogram Frequency.
